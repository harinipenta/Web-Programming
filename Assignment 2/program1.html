<p class = "f"> Eating a healthy, balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health, and can help you feel your best.
This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions,
and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.
When choosing foods, focus on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy products.
Many people don't consume the recommended amounts of nutrients, which increases their risk for various illnesses.
To meet nutrient recommendations, you should choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods from each
food group and limit intake of saturated fat, cholesterol salt and added sugars.

<p class = "f"> 100 foods that can serve as the basis of your Healthiest Way of Eating. Links to the articles about these foods can be found below.
In addition to questions about our foods, we often get asked about beverages and sweeteners. In the beverage category, water and green tea have been
especially popular topics, and in the sweetener category, so have blackstrap molasses, honey and maple syrup. Of course, there are many other nutritious
foods other than those that we have included on our list that we feel are wonderful, health-promoting foods; if there are other whole foods - such as
fruits, vegetables, nuts/seeds, whole grains, etc - that you like, by all means enjoy them.
