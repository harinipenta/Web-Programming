Chicken 65, wow! Its one of those popular dishes prepared in most of the dhabas and restaurants.
I remember that whenever we friends visited the dhabas it was the Chicken 65 that was first ordered by most of us and is also the dish most adorable to the kids.
Chicken 65 is a spicy, red, deep fried chicken chunks served as bar snack, entrée or quick appetizer accompanied by onion slices, slit green chilies and lemon wedges.
The preparation of Chicken 65 differs from one place to another according to their taste.

<p class = "sh"> INGREDIENTS: </p>

<ul>
<li> 300 gm chicken breast, cleaned and cut into small cubes (boneless) </li>
<li> ¼ cup thick plain yogurt (or ½ cup buttermilk) </li>
<li> ½ tsp Kashmiri chilli powder (adjust to taste)</li>
<li> ½ tsp cumin powder </li>
<li> ¼ tsp black pepper powder </li>
<li> ½ tsp turmeric powder </li>
<li> ½ tsp coriander powder </li>
<li> 2 tsp ginger garlic paste </li>
<li> 2 tsp rice flour or corn flour (corn starch) </li>
<li> A fistful of curry leaves </li>
<li> 2-3 cups of oil, for frying </li>
<li> 1 tsp vinegar (optional) </li>
</ul>

<p class = "sh"> INSTRUCTIONS: </p>

<ol>
<li> Mix the yogurt with all the spices, corn flour, ginger-garlic paste, and some salt. Add the vinegar only if your yogurt is not sour. </li>
<li> Add the chicken pieces to this and mix well. </li>
<li> Refrigerate this mixture for about 2 hours to let the marinade work its magic on the chicken pieces. You can also leave it overnight in the refrigerator </li>
<li> When you are ready to fry, heat the oil in a kadai or pan. The amount of oil should be enough to almost cover the pieces so the quantity required will depend on your pan. </li>
<li> Gently add the marinated chicken pieces one by one without overlapping and fry on a medium-low flame until golden brown, turning every once in a while. The outside should turn a dark golden brown otherwise the meat won't be cooked through. </li>
<li> The chicken pieces will shrink a bit on frying as the moisture leaves the meat. The sizzling of the oil will also die down almost completely. </li>
<li> Do a quick taste test and remove from the oil. Drain on paper towels as you fry the next batch. Add the curry leaves when you are frying up the last batch and let it turn crisp.</li>
<li> Drain and add curry leaves to the fried pieces of chicken. Give everything a quick stir and serve hot with lemon wedges and raw sliced onions </li>
</ol>
